# WebXR for HoloPlay (Unofficial!)

Implements the WebXR API (using [webxr-polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill))
for [Looking Glass Factory](https://lookingglassfactory.com/)'s HoloPlay devices.

This project contains both a **library** and a **WebExtension** that injects the library before page load.

This repo contains builds of both the library and the (unpacked) extension.
In order to install the extension, simply clone the repository and point your browser at the directory.
(Tested in Chrome 89 and Firefox 86.)

- To install in Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`, select the `Load Unpacked` button, and point at the cloned directory.

Thanks to [WebXR Emulator Extension](https://github.com/MozillaReality/WebXR-emulator-extension)
from which I took the skeleton of this project.

## [Live Demo](https://kai.graphics/holoplay-webxr/third_party/webxr-samples/)

This fork of [webxr-samples](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-samples)
has been modified to unconditionally use WebXR for HoloPlay instead.

## Status

- Only tested on a single
    [Looking Glass 8.9" dev kit](https://docs.lookingglassfactory.com/Gettingstarted/8-9/).
    (Additional testing would be appreciated!)
- Extension has not been published in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.

## Compatibility

- [webxr-samples](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-samples): Works!
- Three.js: Technically works, but can only handle 2 views.
    Often fails to launch in Chrome, due to an unattributed DOMException.
    ([tested page](https://threejs.org/examples/webxr_vr_cubes.html))
- Babylon.js: Works! [Fixed](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/9853) in version `5.0.0-alpha.9`.
    ([tested page](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#F41V6N))
- Sketchfab: Renders a blank screen (not sure why).

## Hacking

- `npm run build` to build.
- `npm run serve` to serve the demos.
